jQuery.Sticky.js
================

A lightweight plugin to make elements scroll with window if the are about to disappear from view. Other plugins that attempt to solve the same problem seemed overly verbose and tended to either remove the alter the DOM or make the element fixed which caused other problems on my web app (e.g. shifting element in relation to an animated sidebar).

Usage:

Call sticky on an element with an optional offset.

$( "#sidebar" ).sticky( $( "header" ).height() + 10 );
